 <summary><h3>🧑🏾‍💻 My Coding Journey</h3></summary>
  
   Hey there! I'm Sadiq Ahmed, a passionate full-stack software engineer. It's incredible to think that my journey into this field wasn't what I initially envisioned while growing up. My heart was set on sports or the health industry, but after an internship at the hospital, I realized it wasn't the right fit for me in the long run. So, I decided to explore other possibilities, keeping an eye out for that one thing that would truly inspire me.


As fate would have it, I enrolled in college and took an introductory Java programming class. At first, everything seemed foreign and challenging, and I didn't perform as well as I hoped. However, that experience ignited a spark within me, and I knew I couldn't let it go. I decided to give it another shot, and with determination and preparation, I aced the class. That's when I knew computer science was the path I wanted to pursue.

To gain further validation and insight into the field, I took a C++ programming class and aced that too. It solidified my belief that becoming a software engineer was the right choice for me. I sought advice from a friend who is a software engineer at Snapchat, and he mentioned boot camps as a legitimate path to getting hired. That conversation sealed the deal, and I decided to take the leap.

I recently graduated from App Academy, and I couldn't be more excited about my journey into the world of software engineering. The challenges, the learning, and the opportunities to create meaningful projects have been incredibly rewarding. I'm eager to continue growing and contributing to the tech industry.

As a full-stack software engineer, I'm ready to tackle new challenges, create innovative solutions, and bring my unique perspective to the table. I'm grateful for the twists and turns that led me here, and I can't wait to see where this adventure takes me next.
